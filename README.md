Monitor Windows process creation/deletion events.

Example
=======

```js
import { subscribe } from 'wql-process-monitor/promises';

const processMonitor = await subscribe();

processMonitor.on("creation", ([process, pid, filepath, user]) => {
  console.log(`creation: ${process}::${pid}(${user}) ["${filepath}"]`);
});

processMonitor.on("deletion",([process, pid]) => {
  console.log(`deletion: ${process}::${pid}`);
});

/*
Keep alive
You don't need this if you have something else to keep the event loop running.
This is just an example so Node.js doesn't exit directly.
*/
setInterval(()=>{}, 1000 * 60 * 60);
```

</p>

Do something when a specific process is started :

```js
const processMonitor = await subscribe({
  creation: true,
  deletion: false,
  bin: {
    filter: ["firefox.exe"],
    whitelist: true
  }
});

processMonitor.on("creation", ([process, pid, filepath, user]) => {
  //Do something only when "firefox.exe" is started (_creation_)
});
```

Installation
============

```
npm install wql-process-monitor
```

_Prerequisite: C/C++ build tools (Visual Studio) and Python 3.x (node-gyp) in order to build [node-ffi-napi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffi-napi)._
_üí° Prebuilt binaries are provided so in most cases the above mentioned prerequisites aren't needed._

API
===

‚ö†Ô∏è This module is only available as an ECMAScript module (ESM) starting with version 2.0.0.<br />
Previous version(s) are CommonJS (CJS) with an ESM wrapper.

üí° Promises are under the `promises` namespace.
```js
import * as WQL from 'wql-process-monitor';
WQL.promises.createEventSink() //Promise
WQL.createEventSink() //Sync

import * as WQL from 'wql-process-monitor/promises';
WQL.createEventSink() //Promise
```

## Named export

### `subscribe(option?: obj): AsyncEventEmitter`

‚öôÔ∏è Options:

- creation | boolean (_default true_)

  Subscribe to the creation event

- deletion | boolean (_default true_)

	Subscribe to the deletionn event

- dir
  
  + filter | string[] (_default none_)
  
    Exclude events originating from a list of path(s). This can be a full path or a part of it.<br/>
    Path separator can either be `/` (Unix) or `\\` (Windows).
    
    ‚ö†Ô∏è NB: Using this will prevent you to catch any elevated process event.<br/>
	Unless you are also elevated. This is a permission issue (See [#2](https://github.com/xan105/node-processMonitor/issues/2)).<br/>
	_You can implement your own filter on top of the event emitter result instead._
    
  + whitelist | boolean (_default false_)

    Turn the above filter option into a whitelist instead of a blacklist.<br/>
    Only the events originating from the list will be allowed.
    
- bin
  
  + filter | string[] (_default none_)
  
    List of process to exclude.<br/>
    eg: ["firefox.exe", "chrome.exe", ...]<br/>
    
  - whitelist | boolean (_default false_)

	  Turn the above filter option into a whitelist instead of a blacklist.<br/>
    Only the process from the list will be allowed.

‚ö†Ô∏è NB: `There are limits to the number of AND and OR keywords that can be used in WQL queries. Large numbers of WQL keywords used in a complex query can cause WMI to return WBEM_E_QUOTA_VIOLATION. The limit of WQL keywords depends on how complex the query is`<br/>
	cf: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/querying-with-wql<br/>
	When you are using the `filter` option with a huge list consider implementing your own filter on top of the event emitter result instead.

=> Return a non-blocking async event emitter ([emittery](https://github.com/sindresorhus/emittery)):

```ts
.on(event: "creation | deletion", ([
    process: string, //process name
    pid: string, //process identifier
    filepath: string, //file location path
    user: string //process owner
]) => {})
```

‚ö†Ô∏è NB: `filepath` and/or `user` _might_ be empty if you don't have the permission to access a process information.

üí° Don't forget to keep the node.js event loop alive.

### `createEventSink(): void`

Initialize the event sink.<br/>
This is required to do before you can subscribe to any events.<br/>
If the event sink is already initialized then nothing will be done.

üí° Since version >= 2.0.0 this is automatically done for you when you call `subscribe()`.<br/>
Method was merely kept for backward compatibility.

‚ö†Ô∏è If your application (the caller thread) is initializing a COM library you need to set the thread model to [COINIT_MULTITHREADED](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializeex)
For this reason using this in Electron's main process isn't viable. If you really need to use Electron's main process; I suggest that you either
- fork a node child process or
- use web workers or
- use a hidden browser window and communicate between the main process and background window via Electron's IPC.


### `closeEventSink(): void`

**Properly** close the event sink.<br/>
There is no 'un-subscribe' thing to do prior to closing the sink. Just close it.<br/>
It is recommended to properly close the event sink when you are done if you intend to re-open it later on.<br/>
Most of the time you wouldn't have to bother with this but it's here in case you need it.
